# To the code session (written by the operations session)

The operations session adds a section at the TOP of `## OPEN` for every deploy (hash and UTC
time, or why it did not ship), every new fault or FAIL or TESTED from the tester's box (box id,
board number, the tester's words verbatim), every outage and every revert. The code session
reads it on its routines and never edits this file.

Last TO_OPS.md section handled: 8 Oct, 16:20Z — ship after 1274981: 422bc93 (2579, the RO-014 line of box 46762)

## OPEN

### 8 Oct, 15:55Z — 422bc93 (2579) received, verified, queued sixth

- **§3 check**: on `claude/ally-app-docs-ctezil`, one board item. Server-side filters only
  (`personFlip.ts`, `askChoices.ts`). No prompt or tool text changes, so no D44 record is needed.
- **Pre-verify**: origin/main `2d1e599` + the six handed commits in order (4b3e446, 6df7e63,
  88ecbe3, 9a2fadf, 1274981, 422bc93): `npm run verify` green. 713 suites passed (5 skipped),
  7484 tests passed (38 skipped).
- **Order**: 6df7e63 → 88ecbe3 → 9a2fadf → 1274981 → 422bc93. All still wait on Misho's access
  setting. 2579 stays `to_build` after its LIVE, as you wrote.
- **Box 46861**: no fault. The 1850 snooze is not testable today; the tester sets up a 5-question
  fixture before tomorrow's 15:00Z card.

### 8 Oct, 15:36Z — box 46795: 1850 (617dcb8) the asker's line at the card hour PASS 1 of 1; stays being_tested

Tester, verbatim: „Asker 178580, conv 42484, at 15:00:31Z: „Netai Test Helper Card8: კითხვა მიუვიდა,
პასუხს ველოდები". -> the DONE WHEN of 617dcb8 is met, 1 of 1." and „1850 stays BEING_TESTED: the
whole DONE WHEN (5 questions in a day -> 2 at once + 3 in one card, yes/no/later each, and the
card's one snooze bringing it back ~2 h later) is not covered by this look. … the snooze is still
untested." No board change is needed. 46828: the tester is still waiting for the LIVE of 3400, 3369 and 3268.

### 8 Oct, 15:30Z — 1274981 (3367) received, verified, queued fifth

- **§3 check**: on `claude/ally-app-docs-ctezil`, one board item. No prompt or tool-description
  text changes: `mcp/handlers.ts` adds the data field `waiting_for`. No D44 record needed.
- **Pre-verify**: origin/main `2d1e599` + 4b3e446 + 6df7e63 + 88ecbe3 + 9a2fadf + 1274981:
  `npm run verify` green. 712 suites passed (5 skipped), 7477 tests passed (38 skipped).
- **Order**: 6df7e63 → 88ecbe3 → 9a2fadf → 1274981. All still wait on Misho's access setting.
- **Frontend line**: noted. One line goes in docs/FOR_FRONTEND.md after 1274981 is live.

### 8 Oct, 15:22Z — box 46762: one broken line under RO-014 (task 2579), the rest PASS

From the tester's 46762 (MASTER TEST RUN chat #5 close, 15:20Z, build 1ec9bd4), verbatim:

> - RO-014 PASS: 8 of 8 asks reworded (2 at once, 6 at the card), none in the owner's own words. One line broken: "იცნობს თუ არა კარგ ბუღალტერს." (third person, a full stop) — line added to task 2579, with a gym button "ამ სპორტდარბაზში დავდივარ" that names no gym.

Same message, PASS: LM-002 (held asks out at 15:00–15:02Z, 2→2 and 3→3), LM-004, LM-006 Q3, RO-014
(apart from the line above). LM-003 is set up; its reads are at 17:25Z and 18:10Z.
46763 (NEW TESTER CHAT #9, 15:15Z): still waiting for the LIVE of 3400, 3369 and 3268.
Shipping still waits on Misho's access setting; nothing marked or posted in the box yet.

### 8 Oct, 15:14Z — 9a2fadf (3302) received, verified, queued fourth

- **§3 check**: on `claude/ally-app-docs-ctezil`, one board item. The server replaces the reply
  after the run; no prompt or tool text changes, so it needs no D44 record.
- **Pre-verify**: origin/main `2d1e599` + 4b3e446 + 6df7e63 + 88ecbe3 + 9a2fadf: `npm run verify`
  green. 711 suites passed (5 skipped), 7466 tests passed (38 skipped).
- **Ship order**: 6df7e63 (3369) → 88ecbe3 (3268) → 9a2fadf (3302), one at a time. All of them
  still wait on Misho's access setting for this session (see the section below).
- **Box**: 46735 from the tester (14:57Z) only says they wait for the LIVE of 3400 and 6df7e63.
  It reports no fault and no result. It is not marked yet.

### 8 Oct, 15:02Z — first handoff received; 3400 is live, 3369 and 3268 not shipped yet

- **4b3e446 (3400)** is live as `9068735`: deploy `d4b916d9` started 14:57:54Z, SUCCESS by
  14:59:31Z. Its LIVE post to the box and the board move to `being_tested` are NOT done yet
  (see the last point).
- **§3 check** of 4b3e446, 6df7e63 and 88ecbe3: all on `claude/ally-app-docs-ctezil`, one board
  item each, DONE WHEN given in your section. 4b3e446 removes a tool from a run, which is not a
  prompt text. 88ecbe3 changes an owner-facing line, not a model-facing one. Nothing needs a D44
  record.
- **Pre-verify**: origin/main `2d1e599` + 4b3e446 + 6df7e63 + 88ecbe3 cherry-picked in that
  order: `npm run verify` green. 710 suites passed (5 skipped), 7460 tests passed (38 skipped).
- **6df7e63 (3369) and 88ecbe3 (3268) are NOT shipped.** Misho said yes to shipping with
  ship_one.sh, but this session's permission classifier refused even the read-only outage check
  (`outage.sh 20`) against production. I do not work around a refusal. Shipping, the LIVE post
  and the board update wait until Misho allows production access for this session. You will get
  a section here when each one ships.
- **Box**: unread 0 through 46734 at 14:56Z.
