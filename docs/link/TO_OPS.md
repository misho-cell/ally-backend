# To the operations session (written by the code session)

The code session adds a section at the TOP of `## OPEN` for every change ready to ship, every
revert it asks for, and every answer to TO_CODE.md. The operations session reads it on its
routines (see docs/OPS_SESSION.md §4) and never edits this file.

Last TO_CODE.md section handled: (none yet)

## OPEN

### 8 Oct, 15:50Z — ship after 9a2fadf: 1274981 (3367)

**1274981, board 3367.** „რა მელოდება?" / „რა არის ახალი?" now name the owner's own goals waiting
on them — a plan waiting for a yes, a goal whose results are in and nothing is out — on the server
card with why each waits; and any incoming question the reply did not name is listed after it as
its own server card (kind `questions_waiting`, no buttons).
DONE WHEN: QA-047 and NO-005 step 4. On a fresh seat with two incoming questions, one plan
waiting for a yes and one goal with results in, „რა მელოდება?" and „რა არის ახალი?" show both
questions and both goals, each once; a seat whose only waiting thing is its own goal is never
told „ჯერ არაფერი გელოდება".
Frontend: a pending message of the new kind `questions_waiting` (text, empty choices). Please
add one line to docs/FOR_FRONTEND.md after it ships: it draws like any other pending message,
no buttons.

Order still open from earlier sections: 6df7e63, 88ecbe3, 9a2fadf, then 1274981.

### 8 Oct, 15:05Z — ship after the first handoff: 9a2fadf (3302)

**9a2fadf, board 3302.** When a reply claims a deletion („წავშალე", „წასაშლელად მოვნიშნე",
deleted) and no deleting tool ran in that run, the owner reads „ეს ჯერ არ წამიშლია. დამიდასტურე
და ახლავე წავშლი." with a „კი, წაშალე" button instead; the next run deletes it the ordinary way.
DONE WHEN: ME-016 step 4 and PR-036 step 4 on fresh seats. In a NEW conversation „დაივიწყე, რომ
<name> ელექტრიკოსია." never gets „წავშალე" unless forget_contact_fact (or another deleting
tool) ran in that run; after „კი, წაშალე" the fact is gone (get_contact_facts) and not told back
in a next conversation.

Note: 4b3e446 (3400) deployed as 9068735; its LIVE is yours to post, as in the section below.

### 8 Oct, 14:55Z — first handoff: two fixes to ship, after 4b3e446

**Wait first:** the code session is shipping 4b3e446 (3400) itself, the last one it ships. Do
not ship anything until `./scripts/ops/logs.sh deployments 1` shows that commit's cherry-pick
DEPLOYED (subject „fix(chat): no invitation is prepared before the owner says yes to it
(3400)"). Then post its LIVE yourself (text below), and ship the two that follow, in this order,
one at a time. All three are on branch `claude/ally-app-docs-ctezil`.

1. **4b3e446, board 3400 (shipped by the code session; you post the LIVE).** An owner's run
   whose line neither asks for an invitation nor approves one does not hold invite_contact.
   DONE WHEN: GP-066 and PR-035 on fresh seats (a goal whose best contact is not on Netai):
   the first run makes zero invite_contact calls (tool log), and the first reply only offers
   the invitation. After the owner's „yes" to it, invite_contact runs.
2. **6df7e63, board 3369.** „დამაკავშირე <X>-თან" hands the opening second circle the name,
   not the whole sentence; the name follows the Georgian imperative, with „-თან"/„-სთან" cut.
   DONE WHEN: the tester's 3 runs from 46731 again; search_second_degree:opening carries only
   the name („თამაზ ნიმუშაძე"), no web_search:opening.
3. **88ecbe3, board 3268 (small, the tester's 46732).** The kind line writes a Georgian name with
   „-სთვის" together („ბესო გამოგონილისთვის"); a name in other letters keeps the hyphen.
   DONE WHEN: ME-005 once, after the mark „ჰკითხე <name>-ს…"; the line reads „<name>სთვის
   არაფერს ვწერ…".

Nothing for the frontend. The box has been answered by the code session through id 46734.

### 8 Oct, 14:20Z — the link is open

Nothing to ship in this section. Read docs/OPS_SESSION.md first. The first real handoff
follows as its own section.
